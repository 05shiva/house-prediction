## Project Overview
The House Price Prediction system allows users to input house-related data through an Anvil-based web interface. The data is processed by a machine learning model on the backend to predict the estimated price of the house. This project utilizes the power of Anvil for front-end development and integrates backend logic using Python.

## Features
    User-Friendly Frontend: Built using Anvil, it allows users to input house data through an intuitive interface.
    House Price Prediction: Machine learning model predicts the price of a house based on the input features.
    Integration of Frontend and Backend: Anvil front end connected with a Python backend for seamless predictions.
    Real-Time Results: Instantaneous prediction results shown on the frontend after data submission.
## Requirements
    Python 3.8+
    Anvil (for front-end development)
    scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)
    Flask (for the backend logic, if applicable)
    All other dependencies can be found in the respective Python files.

## Setup and Installation
    1. Clone the repository
        bash
        Copy code
        git clone https://github.com/05shiva/House-price-prediction
        cd House-price-prediction
    2. Install dependencies
        Install the required Python packages using pip:
        bash
        Copy code
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    3. Running the Backend
        To run the backend application:

      bash
      Copy code
      python anvil_backend_linker.py
This will set up the backend and link it with the Anvil front-end interface.

## Usage
    Navigate to the Anvil front-end application.
    Enter the required details such as number of bedrooms, location, square footage, etc.
    Submit the form, and the system will display the predicted house price instantly.
### Anvil Deployment
If you want to deploy the project via Anvil:

    Create an account on Anvil.
    Upload the Anvil front-end code to your workspace.
    Link the backend using anvil_backend_linker.py for seamless integration with the front-end.
    Run the application directly from the Anvil platform.
## File Structure
    bash
    Copy code
      ├── anvil_backend_linker.py     # Backend logic that connects with Anvil
      ├── webapp.py                   # Core logic for house price prediction
